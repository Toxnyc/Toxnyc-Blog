                        im a 18y dude living life in blue. I was born in Brazil and grew up in contryside :] I'm the
                        kind of person who doesn't talk much about myself, wich is why I created this site a sort of
                        personal archive so I dont just vanish without a trace someday. A heads-up i make jokes about
                        pretty much anything, often dripping with irony. <br> Just so you know, even though Im a
                        communist, I dont align with the views
                        of most other communist. I was once part of a youth propaganda cell for a political party, but i
                        left due to ideological differences</p>

                    <p>this book reminds me that people in any decade, any time, and any contry share the same feelings,
                        fears and desires. people before me faced the problems and happiness, they loved like me,
                        laughed like me, and suffered. these people experienced all the fellings that humans can fell
                        and died so i could live. the fact that their history doesnt disappear with them comforts me
